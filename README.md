### Notes

* For some reason `airdrop()` in JavaScript test does not work with VPN
* Watch out for validator because `anchor test` automatically runs `solana-validator-test`
* For sizing, 1 (bool) + 32 (Pubkey) + 8 (u64)
* There is an exploit with Anchor when using duplicate accounts in a single instruction
