## Development

**Requirements**

- Anchor 0.16.2
- Solana 1.8.0
- Node 14.18.0

**Running**

A Solana wallet and SOL are required to get started.

```bash
solana-keygen new
yarn protocol:airdrop # Run as long as needed
```

Make sure cluster is set to either `localnet` or `devnet` in `Anchor.toml`, depending on your environment and `.env` is configured correctly.

```bash
yarn protocol:test:localnet
```

Start a demo trading bot.

```bash
yarn protocol:bots:trade:localnet
```

Start a liquidation bot.

```bash
yarn protocol:bots:liquidate:localnet
```

Start the app.

```bash
yarn app:start
```

To deploy the entire protocol on, for example, `devnet`, make sure the correct cluster is set in `Anchor.toml` and run the following.

```bash
yarn protocol:clean
yarn protocol:build:devnet
yarn protocol:deploy:devnet
# Update Anchor.toml and the program id declarations with the deployment public keys
yarn protocol:test:devnet
```

## Documentation

This is currently handled with Docusauraus.

```bash
yarn docs:start
```
