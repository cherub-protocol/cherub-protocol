yarn protocol:airdrop # Run as long as needed
```

Make sure cluster is set to either `localnet` in `Anchor.toml` and `.env` is configured correctly.

To deploy the protocol on `devnet`, make sure the correct cluster is set in `Anchor.toml` and `.env` and run the following.

```bash
solana config set --url https://api.devnet.solana.com
yarn protocol:clean
yarn protocol:build
yarn protocol:deploy
# Update Anchor.toml and the program id declarations with the deployment public keys
yarn protocol:test
```
