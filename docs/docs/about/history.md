# History

At the end of 2020, computer programmer Pindaroso discovered inverse perpetual futures contracts and had a brief trading affair. In September 2021, the Solana Ignition hackathon was announced and seemed like the perfect opportunity to innovate on exchange design while simultaneously getting to explore a new piece of blockchain technology. The project was based on improving liquidation practices through insurance fund mechanics by combining concepts from [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) and [Olympus DAO](https://www.olympusdao.finance/). After receiving positive feedback on the project submission, Cherub has since become a full-time effort.
