# Introduction

## What is Cherub?

Cherub is a decentralized finance ([DeFi](terminology.md#defi)) inverse perpetuals protocol for **trading**, **investing** and **building**. It runs on the [Solana](https://solana.com/) network and is governed by a Decentralized Autonomous Organization ([DAO](terminology.md#dao)).

This project is inspired by [Olympus DAO's](https://www.olympusdao.finance/) [(3, 3)](terminology.md#(3,3)) incentive model for aligning users. It offers a solution to game theory's Prisoner's Dilemma problem. While traders require deep liquidity, investors have to lock up capital, and builders can potentially pump and dump, Cherub offers a unique solution in the form of a unique virtual automated market maker ([AMM](terminology.md#amm)) decentralized exchange ([DEX](terminology.md#dex)) governed by a DAO.

The protocol relies on [staking](terminology.md#staking) and [bonding](terminology.md#bonding). It uses staked, or protocol-owned liquidity, in the form of a productive treasury to receive and distribute trading fees, while selling discounted protocol tokens via bonding.

## Why Cherub?

Centralized exchanges do not pass value on to users. Cherub attempts to solve this problem by being the best protocol for traders, investors and builders.

## Who is working on this?

The project was ideated by Pindaroso and is being built by a distributed pseudo-anonymous team.

## Who runs Cherub?

No one. Cherub is DAO-governed. All decisions are formed by community members on the forum and made by token holders through snapshot voting.
