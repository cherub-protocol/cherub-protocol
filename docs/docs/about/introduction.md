# Introduction

## What is Cherub?

The Cherub Protocol is a decentralized finance ([DeFi](/docs/about/terminology#decentralized-finance-defi)) inverse perpetuals protocol for **trading**, **staking** and **bonding**. It runs on the [Solana](https://solana.com/) network and is governed by a decentralized autonomous organization ([DAO](/docs/about/terminology#decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao)).

This project is inspired by the [OlympusDAO](https://www.olympusdao.finance/) ([3, 3](/docs/about/terminology#(3,3))) incentive model for aligning users. While traders require deep liquidity, stakers have to lock up capital, and bonders can potentially [pump-and-dump](/docs/about/terminology#pump-and-dump), Cherub offers a unique solution to game theory's [prisoner's dilemma](/docs/about/terminology/#prisoners-dilemma) problem in the form of a $50/50$ invariant virtual automated market maker ([AMM](/docs/about/terminology#automated-market-maker-amm)) decentralized exchange ([DEX](/docs/about/terminology#decentralized-exchange-dex)) governed by a DAO via the `SERAPHIM` token.

The protocol relies on [staking](/docs/about/terminology#stake) and [bonding](/docs/about/terminology#bond). It uses staked, or protocol-owned liquidity, as a productive treasury, to receive and distribute trading fees to `CHERUB` holders while rewarding discounted protocol tokens through bonding.

## Why Cherub?

Cherub offers the best user experience for retail users. It does this through low trade fees, no minimum trade size, and quotes trading pairs in USD ([inverse perpetuals](/docs/inverse-perpetuals)).
