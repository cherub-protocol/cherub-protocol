# DAO

The Cherub Protocol requires capital to operate. Capital is used to fund engineering and community management efforts. The [DAO](/docs/about/terminology#decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao) token for Cherub is known as [CHRB](/docs/about/terminology#dchrb) and the minted tokens are distributed through treasury diversification swaps or accrued using a three-tiered vesting schedule. Token holders can be thought of as members of a social club responsible for managing the protocol development through treasury management.

Treasury management is based on voting. Any CHRB holder may create or vote on a proposal. Treasury diversification rounds can be done with other protocols, DAOs and venture capital. This is the ideal framework for accomplishing decentralized management. It is important to note that the DAO token has no intrinsic value and can only be used for voting. It does not receive rewards like [sCHRB](/docs/about/terminology#schrb) or [bCHRB](/docs/about/terminology#chrb) token. See [tokenomics](/docs/about/terminology#tokenomics) for more information.

## Vision

Our mission is to create the best perpetuals [DEX](/docs/about/terminology#decentralized-exchange-dex) user experience possible for retail users by allocating and diversifying capital in the treasury.

## Strategy

An optimal path for positioning Cherub in such a competitive landscape includes making it informative, educational and accessible for users to [trade](/docs/about/terminology#trade), [bond](/docs/about/terminology#bond) and [stake](/docs/about/terminology#stake).

## Tactics

The DAO believes there are three main features that make Cherub exceptional for retail use:

* Quoting perps in USD as [inverse perpetuals](/docs/inverse-perpetuals)
* Low protocol and blockchain fees
* $1$ USD trade minimum
