# FAQ

## What makes Cherub unique?

The Cherub Protocol is a perpetuals exchange focused on retail [traders](/docs/about/terminology#trade), [bonders](/docs/about/terminology#bond) and [stakers](/docs/about/terminology#stake). It is also the first inverse perpetuals market on Solana and features a uniquely integrated [vAMM](/docs/about/terminology#virtual-automated-market-maker-vamm) design featuring a dynamic liquidation engine based on bonding governed by a [DAO](/docs/about/terminology#decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao) ([3, 3](/docs/about/terminology#3-3)).
